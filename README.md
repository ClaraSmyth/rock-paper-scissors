# rock-paper-scissors

Rock Paper Scissors project for TheOdinProject

Update 1 - Game is fully working in console, created new git branch to work on adding a UI to the game. Will also clean up some of the original code.

Update 2 - Game now has working buttons and a live scoreboard. Currently has no end game feature and no styling just default html elements and text but it works. Still need to finish off the javascript before I start working on styling the page with CSS.

Update 3 - Game fully working with a UI now, still not styled at all. Merged rps-ui branch with the main branch. Will now work mostly on styling the webpage so it doesn't look so bad.

Update 4 - Fully styled and responsive. Unsure if I should add color or leave it black and white, cant decide. Will merge with the main branch for now.
