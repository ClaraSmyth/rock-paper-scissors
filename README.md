# Rock Paper Scissor

Live Version - [Click here!](https://clarasmyth.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/)

This is my first project using JavaScript, it was created for [TheOdinProject](https://www.theodinproject.com/).


## Lessons Learned

I learned how to apply the fundamentals of JavaScript, which I learned through TheOdinProject.
I found JavaScript to be very difficult at first but by working on this project it really helped me wrap my head around the basics of the language.

Some of what I learned:
- Basics ( Variables, Functions , Operators etc )
- Data Types and Conditionals
- Arrays and Loops
- DOM Manipulation and Events
- How to use the console and debugger to solve problems


## Notes

These are the notes I created as I worked through the project.

- Update 1 - Game is fully working in console, created new git branch to work on adding a UI to the game. Will also clean up some of the original code.

- Update 2 - Game now has working buttons and a live scoreboard. Currently has no end game feature and no styling just default html elements and text but it works. Still need to finish off the javascript before I start working on styling the page with CSS.

- Update 3 - Game fully working with a UI now, still not styled at all. Merged rps-ui branch with the main branch. Will now work mostly on styling the webpage so it doesn't look so bad.

- Update 4 - Fully styled and responsive. Unsure if I should add color or leave it black and white, cant decide. Will merge with the main branch for now.

- Update 5 - Added a nice pop up to show the final game outcome.
